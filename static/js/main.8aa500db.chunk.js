When Joe was 17, he was looking for a novel idea for his Boy Scout Eagle Project. He created VACHI as a student club at his local high school. The goal was to educate students, teachers, administrators and parents about the incidence of all forms of hate behavior including those most prevalent on high school campuses (e.g. name calling, bullying, harassment). Joe researched the subject of bullying, investigated best practices for anti-bullying programs, and tried to create an infrastructure that was capable of replication at any high school (or middle school). Joe authored a school survey and working with high school English teachers and administrators, it was given to every high school student during their English class.  When the results established that his own high school was a venue where many students felt unsafe because they had either witnessed or been victimized by hate behavior, Joe and the initial VACHI club members went to work. Joe found or created activities to promote tolerance and celebrate diversity, including celebrating GLSEN's No Name Calling Week and sponsoring a \u201cTies for Tolerance\u201d contest. Working with community resources from the mayor\u2019s office, public safety, and religious leaders, Joe organized a community wide showing of solidarity when the Westboro Baptist Church targeted his high school\u2019s production of the Laramie Project, one of the school wide activities to help teach the lessons needed to promote a more accepting student body and community. Joe worked with the school board to help promote and ultimately adopt new school anti-discrimination and hate motivated behavior policies and raised funds to purchase anti-bullying curriculum, provide transportation for the annual Museum of Tolerance field trip, and even worked with younger scouts to fund buddy benches at the local elementary school. He worked with web designers to build this website with the resources and forms so that any teenager could bring this kind of school club to their community. Joe\u2019s efforts have been recognized when he won the prestigious Spirit of Anne Frank Award in 2015 and the Diller Tikkun Olam Award which produced a video about Joe\u2019s efforts to end hate behavior.
