Right? While children have sung that song since before any of us can remember, a new club at Coronado High School in Coronado, California knows that words can hurt. Voices Against Cruelty, Hatred and Intolerance, known as VACHI for short, seeks to educate students, teachers and parents about the harm caused from hate motivated behavior, including bullying, harassment and name-calling. VACHI hopes that with education they can eliminate hate motivated behavior on campus.</p>\r\n                    <p>VACHI, the brain-child of junior, Joey Langerman, who was looking for a novel idea for his Boy Scout Eagle Project, is believed to be the first club of its kind. But that fact doesn’t stop Joey from thinking globally. One of the first things Joey did was work with local web designer who donated his time for the project. VACHI now has a web presence that will help to bring the \"No Hate\" message to other schools around the country.</p>\r\n                    <p>Joey was motivated when he read about several students who committed suicide after being bullied at their schools. Despite reporting those incidents to school officials, nothing changed and finally several teens killed themselves. While none of those suicides occurred in Coronado, Joey knew that kids at his school were contributing to the spread of hate. He hopes VACHI will spark a change. VACHI created, funded and placed <a href=\"/merchandise\">\"No Hate Zone\"</a> signs (available on their website) in each classroom and teachers made sure that students were aware of the new philosophy. VACHI’s message is clear: every student is entitled to a physically and emotionally safe place to go to school.</p>\r\n                    <p>VACHI;'s hope is to empower students to stop spreading hate and to stand up against hate when it is witnessed. In his research to start this club, Joey learned that most incidents of bullying and harassment are unreported because the victims are afraid and feel powerless. Joey thought that if it became \"cooler\" to speak out against hate than to side with the abuser, maybe the incidence of hate would be reduced. The message to students is simple: Think before YOU speak and if you see someone bullying, harassing or name calling another student, stand up and say, \"Hey, that's not cool\". If everyone then sided with the victim, the abuser would lose his power. \"Hate behavior is about power. If we take the power away, we can stop the hate,\" says Joey.</p>\r\n                    <p>VACHI recognizes that hate behavior is learned. VACHI encourages parents to model tolerance and help teach the \"No Hate\" message. VACHI is hoping other high school students will <a href=\"/chapter\">start chapters</a> in their school (materials available on their website). The club's email is hatehurts@vachi.net. VACHI also has a Facebook page. Joey asks that everyone become a VACHI FAN on Facebook. Joey's final words ring strong: \"Together, we can start a movement.\"</p>\r\n                    <p>January 27, 2010 – <a href = {eagleImg} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> Coronado Eagle and Journal (No Name Calling Week Announcement)</a></p>\r\n                    <p>May 6, 2010 – 10News.com <a href = {news10Img} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">article</a> about VACHI’s survey at local highschool.

The policy should be updated regularly to insure that it adequately serves the purposes of preventing discrimination, harassment, bullying and any other hate motivated behavior. Organizations such as the California School Board Association have model policies that can be adopted. Neighboring school districts may have already passed comprehensive policies that can be used as examples. The policies should include, at a minimum, a non-discrimination/harassment <a href = \"/nondiscriminationpolicy\">policy</a>, a sexual harassment <a href = \"/sexualharrasmentpolicy\">policy</a>, and a hate motivated behavior <a href = \"/hatemotivatedbehaviorpolicy\">policy</a>. The policies must have an easy to follow complaint procedure that applies to any complaint of discrimination, harassment or other hate-motivated behavior. In recognition that many victims of harassment and bullying will not report on their own behalf, the policies should mandate that any teacher who witnesses or is otherwise aware of any incident of harassment, bullying or other hate motivated behavior, should report to the administration on behalf of the student.</p>\r\n                    <p >In addition to district wide policies, each school in the district should clearly define for all students what prohibited behavior is. While the school should publish the rules for students to read, because many students will not take the time to read the published school rules, in any introductory assembly where students are reminded of appropriate school behavior, clear and specific definitions of hate motivated behavior must be provided. Many students simply don’t realize that the day to day name calling that has become part of student life is prohibited and hurtful. Each teacher should have a sign posted in his or her classroom that reinforces that name calling, harassment and bullying will not be tolerated. VACHI has created a “No Hate Zone” <a href = \"/sign\">sign</a> that can be used for this purpose.</p>\r\n                    <p >Finally, the best way to stop hate related behavior is for students to become empowered to stop it themselves. Witnesses to bullying, name calling and harassment need to be encouraged to stand up for the victims. Victims need to be told that they should speak up, loudly, and oppose their tormenter. For years, parents have told victims to ignore their bullies but that does not work. If it becomes “more cool” to not bully maybe bullying will stop. VACHI seeks to send the message to students that it is OK to shout out against name calling and to ask for help. VACHI seeks to embolden witnesses to stand up with the victim and shut the bullies down.

When Joe was 17, he was looking for a novel idea for his Boy Scout Eagle Project. He created VACHI as a student club at his local high school. The goal was to educate students, teachers, administrators and parents about the incidence of all forms of hate behavior including those most prevalent on high school campuses (e.g. name calling, bullying, harassment). Joe researched the subject of bullying, investigated best practices for anti-bullying programs, and tried to create an infrastructure that was capable of replication at any high school (or middle school). Joe authored a school survey and working with high school English teachers and administrators, it was given to every high school student during their English class.  When the results established that his own high school was a venue where many students felt unsafe because they had either witnessed or been victimized by hate behavior, Joe and the initial VACHI club members went to work. Joe found or created activities to promote tolerance and celebrate diversity, including celebrating GLSEN's No Name Calling Week and sponsoring a “Ties for Tolerance” contest. Working with community resources from the mayor’s office, public safety, and religious leaders, Joe organized a community wide showing of solidarity when the Westboro Baptist Church targeted his high school’s production of the Laramie Project, one of the school wide activities to help teach the lessons needed to promote a more accepting student body and community. Joe worked with the school board to help promote and ultimately adopt new school anti-discrimination and hate motivated behavior policies and raised funds to purchase anti-bullying curriculum, provide transportation for the annual Museum of Tolerance field trip, and even worked with younger scouts to fund buddy benches at the local elementary school. He worked with web designers to build this website with the resources and forms so that any teenager could bring this kind of school club to their community. Joe’s efforts have been recognized when he won the prestigious Spirit of Anne Frank Award in 2015 and the Diller Tikkun Olam Award which produced a video about Joe’s efforts to end hate behavior. <a href = \"https://www.dillerteenawards.org/recipient/joe-langerman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" >https://www.dillerteenawards.org/recipient/joe-langerman/</a></p>\r\n          \r\n      </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n  )\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","\nimport './App.css';\n\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n\nimport Header from \"./components/Header\"\nimport Navbar from \"./components/Navbar\"\nimport Home from \"./components/Home\";\nimport BullyingWebsites from \"./components/BullyingWebsites\";\nimport PSAs from \"./components/PSAs\";\nimport News from \"./components/News\";\nimport Forms from \"./components/Forms\";\nimport Merchandise from \"./components/Merchandise\";\nimport Contact from \"./components/Contact\";\nimport Header2 from './components/Header2';\nimport Chapter from './pages/Chapter';\nimport HateMotivatedBehaviorPolicy from './pages/HateMotivatedBehaviorPolicy';\nimport Letters from './pages/Letters';\nimport MembershipForm from './pages/MembershipForm';\nimport NonDiscriminationPolicy from './pages/NonDiscriminationPolicy';\nimport SexualHarrasmentPolicy from './pages/SexualHarrasmentPolicy';\nimport Sign from './pages/Sign';\nimport Footer from './components/Footer';\nimport About from \"./components/About\";\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div >\n      <Router>\n        <div className=\"\"> \n        <Header></Header>\n        <Navbar></Navbar>\n        <Header2></Header2>\n      \n        \n        <Switch>\n          <Route path='/vachi' exact component={Home} />\n          <Route path='/bullyingwebsites' component={BullyingWebsites} />\n          <Route path='/psa' component={PSAs} />\n          <Route path='/news' component={News} />\n          <Route path='/forms' component={Forms} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/merchandise\" component={Merchandise} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/contact\" component={Contact} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/chapter\" component={Chapter} /> \n          <Route exact path=\"/hatemotivatedbehaviorpolicy\" component={HateMotivatedBehaviorPolicy} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/letters\" component={Letters} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/membershipform\" component={MembershipForm} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/nondiscriminationpolicy\" component={NonDiscriminationPolicy} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/sexualharrasmentpolicy\" component={SexualHarrasmentPolicy} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/sign\" component={Sign} />\n          <Route exact path =\"/about\" component = {About} />\n        </Switch>\n        </div>\n        <Footer></Footer>\n      </Router>\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
